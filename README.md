# Questions to answer

- Could the sign-up month (e.g. specific promo lead to sign-up cohort) relate to customer churn? 
  Is there a cohort or cohorts who have a higher rate of churn than other cohorts? 
  (Plot the rate of churn on a line chart where x is the tenure and y is the rate of churn (customers churned/total     customers))
  
- Are there features that indicate a higher propensity to churn? e.g. internet service, type of phone service, online security and backup, senior citizens, paying more than x% of customers with the same services, etc.?

- Is there a price threshold for specific services where the likelihood of churn increases once price for those services goes past that point? If so, what is that point for what service(s)?

- If we looked at churn rate for month-to-month customers after the 12th month and that of 1-year contract customers after the 12th month, are those rates comparable?
